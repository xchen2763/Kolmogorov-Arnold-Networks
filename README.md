# KAN as Interpretable Alternatives to MLPs for Symbolic Function Regression

This is the github repo for the final project of the Columbia University course EECS6699: Mathematics of Deep Learning. Our project is focused on studying the characteristics of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which are promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).
The original paper: ["KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756).

Authors: Haoyu Dong, Xudong Chen, Yu Jia, Jiajun Jiang

## Installation
An environment with Python 3.9.7 or higher version is required, as well as `pip` package.

```
git clone https://github.com/xchen2763/Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks

cd Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart
Run [Interpretability_RMSE_Comparison.ipynb](./Interpretability_RMSE_Comparison.ipynb), [Grid_Extension.ipynb](./Grid_Extension.ipynb) and [Depth_Analysis.ipynb](./Depth_Analysis.ipynb) for reproducing the results.
